# Smile_Classification

Classified the smile of people into POSITIVE SMILE, 
NEGATIVE SMILE and NOT SMILE classes. Created a
robust model by training it with images of different
facial expressions in different environments.
Trained VGG-16, ResNet50, and EfficientNet models
using Transfer Learning. EfficientNet gave the best
performance.
